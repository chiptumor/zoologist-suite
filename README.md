# zoosuite

Behold, my tediously-organized and properly-sourced collection of all the Zoologist art I could gather.

## Privacy/Consent

I don't usually ask before putting art here, so there oughta be a few entries that the artist of such doesn't want up here.

If that is your case, or the case of someone you care about, please let me know&mdash;I will happily hide or remove it.

If you would only prefer your piece is *hidden*&mdash;still in the repository, so you can find it if you dig, but not accessible when using the site&mdash;that can be done easily. It would actually be preferable to removing it from the repository entirely, as exclusion is unreliable without still somehow including the sources somewhere for the public eye to see.

> [!NOTE]
> More info on privacy or consent, including exclusion, will be written soon. I haven't planned that far ahead.

## Submission

If there is a piece you think belongs here, create a file in the [submission directory](<> "Not a thing yet!") with the XML containing all the info you know. Leave blank the parts that you don't know or can't provide, and I'll make attempts to fill those in when accepting it.

Denial should only happen if you don't provide enough info. If you don't believe there's enough info about a piece for it to be accepted, but still believe it to belong here, there's a section to provide all the info you know that doesn't belong anywhere else on the template.
